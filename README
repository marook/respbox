respbox - a responsible lightbox for images

1) Usage


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage

To use respbox you have to respbox.css and respbox.js to your page. The respbox
styles should be added to the <head> element of your page:

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../respbox.css" />

I recommend adding the respbox script include to the end of your <body>:

<script type="text/javascript" src="respbox.js"></script>

Any image link can be displayed via respbox. Here's a simple example of such a
link:

<a class="myImageLinks" href="my_image.jpg" targetWidth="1024" targetHeight="786">image thumbnail goes here</a>

Now you only have to tell respbox it should handle those links:

respbox.applyBySelector('.myImageLinks');

respbox scales images to fit your window size. To enable correct scaling even
after window resize you have to make sure the respbox.updateLayout() function is
called after every window resize:

window.onresize = respbox.updateLayout;
